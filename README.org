Idea for figure about mathematical optimization.

Usually, directly solve an informal biological problem, e.g. 
- find peaks in ChIP-seq data, 
- find clusters in a multivariate data matrix,
- find changepoints in DNA copy number data,
- find the regression function that intersects the most intervals?
- qualitative evaluation on a small number of data sets.
- outsiders without domain knowledge (e.g. ML researcher) can NOT
  work on solving these problems.

My approach, convert to formal mathematical optimization problem,
- define a formal objective function to minimize
- quantitative evaluation (compute the value of the objective
  function, smaller is better)
- benchmark data sets, e.g. neuroblastoma and histone ChIP-seq data
- outsiders without domain knowledge (e.g. mL researcher) CAN work on
  solving these problems.
- e.g. find peaks that minimize the number of incorrectly predicted
  labels in a specific set of ChIP-seq data.
- find breakpoints that minimize the number of incorrectly predicted
  labels in a specific set of DNA copy number data.

Examples of other people working on formal mathematical optimization
problems that I described.
- PeakSeg problem, Paul Fearnhead had an idea for solving it exactly.
- DNA copy number analysis, Alex Drouin expert in tree models, MMIT.
- Many other papers about solvers for the clusterpath problem.
